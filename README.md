SMS Spam Detection - Machine Learning Analysis--

This project focuses on detecting spam messages in SMS datasets using multiple machine learning algorithms and evaluating their performance across different metrics.

 Features

Preprocessed raw SMS text with cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization (TF-IDF).

Applied 10 machine learning algorithms to classify SMS messages into Spam or Ham.

Compared models based on Accuracy and Precision to ensure both performance and reliability.

Generated a final performance report to identify the most effective algorithms.

 Algorithms Used

K-Nearest Neighbors (KN)

Na√Øve Bayes (NB)

Random Forest (RF)

Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

Logistic Regression (LR)

Extra Trees Classifier (ETC)

Gradient Boosting (GBDT)
